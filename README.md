# hitman
Game design inspired from the popular Hitman Go game 

Designed and developed by a team of 3 game engineers in training using Unity3D 
Some of the good stuff tech stuff - 
* MVC design pattern 
* Zenject for Dependency Injection 
* Async-await (so much better than Coroutines :P) 
* Highly de-coupled code through the use of interfaces at different levels of abstraction
